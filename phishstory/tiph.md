[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- A high intensity "Type I" jam breaks away at 9:45 into some low-key exploration. Page adds color as he switches keyboards, and Trey reignites the intensity with some moderate "hose." Finally, the jam gradually ramps down, closing with a return to "Gin."   
  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- The jam breaks at 8:00 into some funky stretching, but Trey quickly seizes on a great riff, which the band coalesces around. As the boys bring the jam up to celebration mode, there is some brief "Woo" jamming before it settles to quieter play with great Page.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Trey teased the _Munsters_ theme in Stash. DWD was unfinished.

[1] Trey on drums and Fish on vacuum.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Drowned](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/drowned>) \- A very cool jam with great Fish and Mike in this upbeat, funky version that transitions into "Chalkdust Torture Reprise."   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture Reprise](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture-reprise>) \- Fun little ditty, and very unlike big brother "CDT" makes only its second appearance ever, transitioning in through a series of stops at the end of a funky version of "Drowned." The third and final version (so far) of "CDT Reprise" was played as final encore (following "Moby Dick," of course) at this thematic show.   
  
[Chalk Dust Torture](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/chalk-dust-torture>) \- Raging version follows the extremely rare appearance (2nd performance ever) of "Chalk Dust Torture Reprise."   
  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- A quintessential version of "2001" that kicks off an all-timer of a second set. No "Moby Dick" teases needed, Trey and Mike are killer in the second jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
In keeping with the theme of the second set, Hood included a Moby Dick tease.
Trey introduced Fish as "Russell Crowe" during Terrapin. The Moby Dick inside of
the HYHU jam featured Trey on drums and Fish on vacuum. The Chalk Dust Reprise
was akin to the version last played on December 10, 1994 (391 shows), with the
band singing the words "Chalk Dust Torture" over varied music. At the end of the
encore, Trey joked that, if anyone missed anything, they should read the book or
see the movie. Trey also teased Moby Dick at the end of the encore's Chalk Dust
Reprise. Prior to this show, Moby Dick had not been played since November 29,
1997 (172 shows).

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Wolfman's Brother](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/wolfmans-brother>) \- Extended funk section which continues until 12:00 when the jam loosens into rocking mode and > to "Johnny B. Goode."   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This single-set performance was part of the 2nd annual Doctor Music Festival
that also featured Blues Traveler, Alice Cooper, Megadeth, Jim Rose, and
Smashing Pumpkins. Trey teased Lazy in Johnny B. Goode. YEM contained a
Wolfman's Brother tease from Trey and the vocal jam was partially based on I
