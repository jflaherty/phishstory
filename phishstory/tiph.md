Reba did not have whistling. DWD's lyrics were changed to "running on my lawn"
and "dancing on my field" and was unfinished. The Final Hurrah was quoted in

from lightning and a curfew for the venue, setbreak was canceled.

[1] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- Begins with the usual Page-led funk on the clav, settles briefly, and picks back up with Trey leading the way. Later, Trey reverts to a rhythmic role as a second, different groove is explored before the closing guitar solo. Here's to more "Tubes" like this in the future. > to "Julius".  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- Very exploratory jam that contrasts sharply with the "old school" style 8/18/12 version. This one more closely resembles standouts from '96 - '04, and includes mode modulation. Messy closing section; needs practice.  
[Carini](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/carini>) \- Serious "HOSE"! Jam quickly breaks from the typically dark, throttling form into the now commonly upbeat, major mode style with good modulation of intensity. It then darkens in minor mode, lightens briefly and -> to "Architect."  

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show featured the Phish debut of Architect. Carini contained a Meatstick
tease from Mike.

Encore  : [ The Squirming Coil ](<https://phish.net/song/the-squirming-coil>)

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Small vocal jam during the intro.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Huge show-opener featuring focused, pretty play, and the interesting sort of innovation associated with 2000 jamming. In lieu of pursuing a "peak," the band plays patiently, deft musicianship on full display, Trey in particular working through a number of ideas and really incredible effects (see: 14:28), culminating in great "strumming" which, later, he revisits note for note.  
[The Moma Dance](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-moma-dance>) \- Trey tears into the jam segment and never lets up. First of a few versions in this very rocking style from 2000. "Tweezer Reprise"-esque playing around 9:40.  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Hypnotic, repetitive jam that leads into vocal jamming (no final WUDMTF lyrics).  
[Limb By Limb](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/limb-by-limb>) \- Jam departs somewhat from the typical direction, but is interesting and well-played. Unfinished with transition to "2001."  
[Also Sprach Zarathustra](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/also-sprach-zarathustra>) \- First minute is must hear. Second jam has enough energy and funk to look illegal and be searched at the border.  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- This one breaks very quickly out of standard raging "Piper" mode into a classic '00, Mike and Page led groove-based jam.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
For his vacuum solo in I Didn't Know, Trey introduced Fish as "Mr. Ralph
Blowenstein." Limb By Limb was unfinished. Trey made several comments during the
show regarding his affinity for the venue. Hood included a small vocal jam
during the intro.

Encore  : [ Possum ](<https://phish.net/song/possum>)

[1] Jam halted while Trey thanked the crowd.  
[2] Lyric changed to "Came to Vermont."  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

[AC/DC Bag](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/acdc-bag>) \- > in from "Buried Alive." Conventional "Bag,", but a fantastic -> to "Ghost." A must-hear show as well.  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- A bold funk intro that is further highlighted by a raging and intense jam with a peak so high it is unscalable by its most ardent fans...the musical equivalent of absinthe injection by machine gun in a crossfire hurricane. [-> in from "Bag." An extended intro leads to a blistering hot straightforward jam that eventually burns out and -> to "Cities."]  
[Cities](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/cities>) \- Great -> into "Cities" from a roaring "Ghost." Starts VERY uptempo, but there's a cool, smooth tempo downshift mid-first verse. Cool little guitar solo at the end taboot.  
[Roggae](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/roggae>) \- A more rhythmic and energized jam section than later versions. Great Fish and Trey.  
[Maze](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/maze>) \- In addition to this being a blistering hot version, at 9:30 the entire band stops on dime in the middle of Trey's solo, Trey thanks the audience, and at 10:00, the band resumes right where it left off.  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Relentless, punishing, and hard rocking jamming place this "Piper" squarely in the same company as the 11/19/97 "Wolfman's Brother" and 12/29/97 "DwD." Like those monsters, this one eventually settles down. -> to "Makisupa."  
[Loving Cup](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/loving-cup>) \- Trey blazes a trail on his 'doc, RAGING LIKE MAD in this excellent version!  
[Possum](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/possum>) \- Awesome version with a great swingy theme to the jam that Trey keeps returning to. Mike is outstanding, and Page plays the Fender-Rhodes for a stretch, adding to the jazzy feel. Includes a "Stash" tease from Trey.  

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The Maze jam was halted while Trey humorously thanked the crowd. Golgi ended
with Hip Hop Hooray quotes by Trey. The last line in Makisupa changed to "came
to Vermont." Trey called Page "Petroff" before he took a piano solo. Trey let
Fish take a drum solo, but told the crowd to whistle if he (Fish) went on too
long.  Trey added that they had a "band rule" that they all begin whistling if
Fish, who likes to ramble when he talks, ever talks for longer than two minutes.
Fish took a boring "drum solo," which drew whistles from the crowd. Piper
contained a Lady (Little River Band) tease from Page and Trey and Possum
contained a Stash tease from Trey. This show is available as an archival release
on LivePhish.com.

[1] No vocal jam; unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- Another version where the jam has a funk section (9:40 - about 14:30) which is quite good and different.  
[Scent of a Mule](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/scent-of-a-mule>) \- Page > vocal/guitar by Trey, with Mike and Fish joining in, and then Page in a funky jam > klezmer > conclusion.  
[Free](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/free>) \- Slow tempo, very funky jam with Trey taking the lead.  
[You Enjoy Myself](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/you-enjoy-myself>) \- Long jam. No B&D;, no VJ, segues into "Waste."  

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This was an outdoor show; the afternoon soundcheck was free and open to the
public. Trey began playing Hell's Bells to the accompaniment of church bells
ringing nearby. During MMMBop, Trey noted: "Fish will now do his version of
James Brown singing Hanson's MMMBop." Fish responded in part that "I'm an
11-year-old sex machine" and that it was "too hot in the hot tub!" Another One
Bites the Dust through Day-O featured the infamous Soundcheck Limbo Karaoke
Contest, where fans were invited on stage to sing, while mic stands were used
for the limbo contest. Page teased Let It Be at the end of And It Stoned Me. YEM
did not contain a vocal jam and was unfinished.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

[Fluffhead](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fluffhead>) \- Mike rules! Another super and dynamic '94, this one isn't blemish free, but also has so much to offer that to pass over it for a couple of rough spots seems unfair. Mike is so solid and present throughout, while cohort Fish fills the tail gunner slot with martial ferocity. The twisted gyrations of Bundle of Joy resolve into a spellbinding whallop of an Arrival.  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Classic version featuring an incredible groove. Mike and Fish lay the foundation as Page becomes more prominent and then Trey just slays. After Trey develops and works through a fantastic theme, full-band play becomes more direct and straight-forward, with a "Paradise City" - or, circa 2014, that "REO Speedwagon" - sound, before the band builds to a powerful, fist-pumping peak.   
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- "HYHU" and "2001" jams. "Donna Lee" and "Who Knows" teases. Incredible version for this period.  

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Llama and Bowie included teases of the _Munsters_ theme song and there was a
brief Free Ride tease at the start of the show. Carolina was sung for Mary
Buckner. There was a Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy tease prior to Landlady.
Tweezer included HYHU, Donna Lee, 2001, and Who Knows teases. Chalk Dust
contained Lawn Boy teases from Trey and Page and was unfinished. The Old Home
Place and Nellie Kane were performed acoustic and, along with Memories, without
microphones.

Tour: Not Part of a Tour  
  
Show Notes: This set was part of the [Rothbury Festival][20]. Trey performed this set solo
acoustic, excepting "BDTNL" through "Chalk Dust" where he was joined by Mike on
bass. Before "Mountains in the Mist" Trey related a story about how he was
asleep in the car on the way to this gig, and when he woke there was a sign that
said "Welcome to Whitehall;" he dedicated the song to all the people in
Whitehall. This show featured the debuts of "Backwards Down the Number Line" and
"Alaska." Trey introduced "BDTNL" as a song written by Tom that arrived in the
mail on his birthday and is "about getting younger or something." After "BDTNL"
Trey asked the crowd to give it up for Mike who he "had just taught that song
five minutes before coming out."
