 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- Those who believe in wormholes will shout "Timber" when they catch a chilling thrilling glimpse into a future haunted house during the early moments of this quarter speed heartbreaker that evolves into a twirling fountain of incandescent sparks passes through a cyclotron and emerges as a multi-dimensional space funk groove. [A strong, rocking "Ghost" includes jamming that is the likely genesis of "Timber," as well as an extended pulsing and electric outro jam that is well regarded by many.]   
  
[Wingsuit](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/wingsuit>) \- Rising from "Ghost's" super spacey >, Trey takes us higher still, his patient soloing inspired and emotive, complimented by Fish's shuffling, upbeat drumming. An early example of the song's potential all but fully realized.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- For the 2nd time in 2014, the band takes "Harry" for a ride into uncharted waters. This time, while Trey and Page alter the harmony away from the familiar, Fish keeps a steady hand on the rudder, eventually guiding the ship safely back to home port.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The ending of BOTT was repeated twice after the song was finished.  Trey
dedicated Antelope to The Dude of Life, who was there with two of his children
who were seeing their first Phish show. Ghost contained teasing of Seven Below
by Mike. Hood contained a brief St. Thomas tease.

Encore  : [ Sleeping Monkey ](<https://phish.net/song/sleeping-monkey>) ^1  > [ Tweezer Reprise ](<https://phish.net/song/tweezer-reprise>)

[1] Dedicated by Page to people affected by Hurricane Sandy. Alternate lyric by
Fish: "my sleeping monkey is redeemed."  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Bizarre version. After swinging through the composed section, Trey augments his tone, and the pitch can easily be considered grating. But his playing remains distilled and deliberate, and, if nothing else, interesting. Any problems here, however, are offset by the others. Page is great. And Fish is a machine. But it is Mike who drives this version, his playing superb throughout, and, in spots, it seems as though he is running lead.   
  
[David Bowie](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/david-bowie>) \- Another good one with multiple minor/major mode shifts. There's also some nice rhythmic shifting and percussive coloring from Fish from 6:53 - 7:57.   
  
[Rock and Roll](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/rock-and-roll>) \- All in all, a quality, multi-section jam. Mike, Page and Fish are strong throughout. If you can just mentally tone down Trey's frequent use of the pitch shifter, it's all good. > to "2001."   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Page drives the jam into an outstanding peak in the final few minutes, and an excellent segue into "Cities" occurs with Fish playing the rhythm of the "Wedge."   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The first set took place during an unrelenting rain storm. Fish teased The Wedge in Cities. Sleeping Monkey was dedicated by Page to people affected by [ Hurricane Sandy ](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy>) and contained an alternate lyric by Fish: "my sleeping monkey is redeemed."

Encore  : [ Frankenstein ](<https://phish.net/song/frankenstein>) > [ Tweezer Reprise ](<https://phish.net/song/tweezer-reprise>)

[1] Debut.  
[2] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Taste](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/taste>) \- Intense, high energy version where the boys seem to add some extra gusto to the jam.   
  
[Maze](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/maze>) \- An exploratory jam develops, very unusual for "Maze." At about 10:45, the jam starts to break away into something well beyond the norm. Pulsing, angry and mean, this foray eventually works back to the expected, fiery conclusion.   
  
[Ghost](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/ghost>) \- Blistered Bella machine gun becomes a fiery pinwheel of metallic jizz before winding back down into a "Ghost" reprise outro. [Strong and varied jamming leads to a release section with "Izabella"-like hose jamming, which cooks nicely before eventually cooling off and returning to "Ghost."]   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show marked the debut of Mock Song and Two Versions of Me, and the Phish
debut of Army of One. Tweezer included a Free tease.

Encore  : [ Wading in the Velvet Sea ](<https://phish.net/song/wading-in-the-velvet-sea>)

[1] Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- Begins with Trey on the mini keyboard before he locks into a melody on the guitar.   
  
[Birds of a Feather](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/birds-of-a-feather>) \- Sure it's all "Type I," but this is a very well played, straight out rocking version.   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- A typically high octane '00 version with an insanely intense jam between verses settles into quick tempo, intense groove. Things gradually settle down, followed by some quieter play with good Mike/Fish teaming and spacey effects from Page and Trey.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
My Friend was unfinished. Tube contained Super Bad teases from Trey. Trey teased
San-Ho-Zay in Birds of a Feather and Piper. During Meatstick, Trey dedicated the
song to the fans that didn't get into the show. Curtain With was played for the
first time since July 29, 1988 (1,177 shows).

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[AC/DC Bag](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/acdc-bag>) \- Giant Country Horns (who also played on 7/14/91, 7/21/91, and 7/25/91). Horns are a great addition. This version was released on Live Phish Vol. 19.   
  
[Mike's Song](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/mikes-song>) \- Giant Country Horns version, definitely worth checking out if you haven't heard "Mike's" avec horns before. GCH also performed on "Mike's" in 1991 on July 11, 14, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25, and 27.   
  
[Weekapaug Groove](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/weekapaug-groove>) \- Great jazzy Mike in the intro, then from about 3:00 - 3:45, the jam takes on an atypical but melodic and uplifting feel.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
This show, officially released as _Live Phish 19_ , featured The Giant Country
Horns for all songs except Reba, Rocky Top, Golgi, The Squirming Coil, My Sweet
One, Hydrogen, both HYHUs, Oh Kee Pa, Adeline, and Fee. It also marked the first
Phish performance of Moose the Mooche, which contained a tease of Rhythm-A-Ning
from Trey. Trey also teased the _Woody Woodpecker_ theme before Golgi. During
the band intros before Donna Lee, Page and Russ teased Killer Joe during Russ's
introduction. Prior to Touch Me, Fish was introduced as the Lizard Queen. Touch
Me featured Fish on trombone. Sweet Adeline was performed without microphones.

 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/sneakin-sally-through-the-alley>) \- Extended bridge with some great Page/Trey interplay. Long vocal jam is "YEM"-like, it gets way beyond "Sally." Must-hear, it's crazy.   
  
[Good Times Bad Times](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/good-times-bad-times>) \- Loose jam that simmers in a slightly sinister way eventually winds back up for a big finish.   
  
[Slave to the Traffic Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/slave-to-the-traffic-light>) \- Unusually long version for this time period. Page is great on the electric piano and organ. Trey shreds impressively in the big, full power finish.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Happy Birthday was sung to "Jen" and was subsequently sung in multiple parts of
Peaches. YEM contained Flash Light teases and the vocal jam was based on "why
should I feed you?." I Didn't Know featured Fish on trombone.
