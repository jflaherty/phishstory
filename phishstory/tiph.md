[1] Trey broke a string and switched guitars mid-song, also introducing his
guitar tech, Brian Brown. Trey then switched to Marimba Lumina and Mike played
Trey's guitar.  
[2] Vocal jam, during which the PA cut out and the band left the stage.
Unfinished.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Cities](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/cities>) \- Early technical issues, a Brian Brown introduction, and a guitar switch do nothing to deter the band from taking "Cities" on a journey across the globe. Some strong but typical jamming leads to more instruments switching and the jam evolves / devolves into highly percussive near free-form jazz.   
  
[Light](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/light>) \- Amusing vocal challenges and a slight return to atonal phrasing by Trey at first. Then this excellent jam courses through hard charging rock, start-stop "woo"-infused play, and funky, "Manteca"-like action. Serious sonic exploration as each player deploys an instrumental weapon of choice, before finally giving way to cathartic space and the rise of the "Wolfman."   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Eine kleine Nachtmusik was teased prior to Party Time. During Cities, Trey broke
a string, switched guitars, and introduced his guitar tech, Brian Brown; Trey
then switched to Marimba Lumina while Mike played Trey's guitar. Wolfman's
contained a vocal jam, during which the PA cut out and the band left the stage.
Wolfman's was unfinished, and after several minutes the band resumed with CDT.

Encore  : [ Possum ](<https://phish.net/song/possum>)


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Tube](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tube>) \- Mike gets down on this right away, Trey picks up quickly, and the whole jam locks in for several minutes.   
  
[Fuego](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fuego>) \- Like the SPAC "Fuego" this jam begins with some quieter musings, followed by a couple of peaking sections. Then the jam turns rhythmic, funky, and almost jazz-like, with some nice Fish and Page, before finally dwindling to transition space.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- This "Hood" has a really great early section, especially between 5:25 - 9:25, where Mike, Page and Trey have this wonderful 3-way musical conversation, while Fish scales the percussion down to a very subtle but key rhythmic foundation.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
The start of this show was delayed due to inclement weather. Fuego contained a
Godzilla tease from Trey and a Cars Trucks Buses tease from Mike.

Encore  : [ You Enjoy Myself ](<https://phish.net/song/you-enjoy-myself>)

[1] No "Myfe" ending.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Party Time](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/party-time>) \- Really solid and extended straightforward jamming with great Page and Trey.   
  
[Split Open and Melt](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/split-open-and-melt>) \- One could argue that they dick around and waste several minutes in the land of "meh." But after the 8:00 mark, this one suddenly gets pretty damn solid with some good old fashioned tension and dissonance. Hell, even throw in a little chaos.   
  
[Kill Devil Falls](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/kill-devil-falls>) \- Intense "Type I" jamming continues after the final lyrics before dipping into some darker playing that quickly brightens before ending with a -> to "MFMF."   
  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Multi-dimensional, very high quality jamming. "Piper" has come back a long way since '09. > to "Free."   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- A very well played version overall, but the ending section in particular is extremely powerful.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
La Grange was played for the first time since [September 22, 1999][5] (301 shows). Twist contained a brief In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida tease from Trey, Kill Devil Falls included a _Jeopardy!_ theme tease, and Hood contained a Kung quote. My Friend My Friend did not contain the "Myfe" ending. YEM contained a Flashlight tease from Mike and teases of the theme to _Sanford and Son_ in the vocal jam.

[1] Unfinished.  
[2] Phish debut.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Down with Disease](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/down-with-disease>) \- Very "Type II" version in which Trey seems to play a less dominant role mid-jam, letting Mike and Page funk it up.   
  
[Harry Hood](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/harry-hood>) \- "Type II" version leaves "Hood" at 9:25, breaks into a low-key groove that gets rocking, then dissonant, and heads home.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Limb By Limb contained a DEG tease from Trey. Disease was unfinished. This show
featured the Phish debuts of Secret Smile and Discern. Hood included a Magilla
tease from Page.

Encore  : [ Suzy Greenberg ](<https://phish.net/song/suzy-greenberg>) ^1  > [ Tweezer Reprise ](<https://phish.net/song/tweezer-reprise>)

[1] The band skipped the second verse.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Piper](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/piper>) \- Super-charged "Type I" bridge jam between verses leads to pulsing groove typical of many '00 "Pipers." Great segue into "Rock and Roll."   
  
[Tweezer](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/tweezer>) \- Segues nicely into "Walk Away."   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Antelope included Yakety Sax and Jibboo teases. The band skipped the second
verse of Suzy. This show was officially released as _Live Phish 05_.

[1] Strange lyrics from Mike and Trey, including an Uno reference.  
[2] Ended akin to Coil, with each member of the band leaving the stage until
only Page was left.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Fee](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/fee>) \- The outro sticks to the "Fee" framework until 9 minutes when Fish picks up the beat, leading to an upbeat segment filled with the blissfull, atmospheric style of jamming that is so representative of the '99 sound. Eventually returns to Earth at 20 minutes and winds down to close. In the realm of "Fee" jams, this weasel reigns supreme.   
  
[Jam](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jam>) \- See Fee Jamming Chart.   
  
[Birds of a Feather](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/birds-of-a-feather>) \- At first a wide-ranging and quality "BOAF" jam, this version then moves beyond, breaking into a "Days Between" jam, and an excellent and extended "If I Only Had A Brain" jam with strange lyrics from Mike and Trey. One of the best "Birds."   
  
[Jesus Just Left Chicago](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/jesus-just-left-chicago>) \- Very easy going and relaxed feel to this version until the ending when the band cranks it up.   
  
[Simple](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/simple>) \- This version ends akin to Coil, with each member of the band having left the stage until only Page was left, soloing.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Birds included a Days Between jam from Page and Mike and several If I Only Had a
Brain teases from Trey. Birds subsequently featured strange lyrics from Mike and
Trey, including an _Uno_ reference. During Meatstick, Trey and Mike put down
their instruments, came to the front of the stage and taught the crowd The
Meatstick Dance. Simple ended akin to Coil, with each member of the band leaving
the stage until only Page was left. At the beginning of the encore, Fish came
out holding the Electrolux vacuum and the band launched into Terrapin (first
since July 11, 1996, or 212 shows).

Goode ](<https://phish.net/song/johnny-b-goode>)

Encore  : [ Julius ](<https://phish.net/song/julius>)

[1] ¡Ole Ole Ole! chant from Trey.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[The Moma Dance](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/the-moma-dance>) \- Strong playing in the early section, as is the case for many '98 renditions of "Moma". The jam segment is extended and has some nice, ascending melodic playing in the last few minutes. Outstanding version for this period.   
  
[Bathtub Gin](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/bathtub-gin>) \- A very nice "Type I" jam mellows into some quiet variations on the "Gin" theme, and then migrates to lush, ambient space.   

  
**Show Notes:**  
  
Frankenstein was preceded by a Frankie Says tease by Fish. After the
Frankenstein, Trey said the band had been waiting and waiting to play some Edgar
Winter in Spain and that this was their chance, adding that they planned on
playing a lot more Edgar Winter as the night went on. The band subsequently
teased Edgar Winter's Free Ride. Sleeping Monkey included ¡Ole Ole Ole! chants
from Trey and a stage appearance by Beatriz (whom Trey had met in a bar the
night before) from Chile. Sleeping Monkey was her favorite song, so Trey
dedicated it to her and she danced while the band played. This three-show run in
Barcelona was originally scheduled for Bikini Club in Barcelona, but was moved
to Zeleste when ticket demand greatly exceeded supply for the original venue.

[3] No whistling.  


  
  
 **Jamchart Notes:**

  
[Reba](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/reba>) \- Great jam featuring "Manteca" teasing and super Trey. After the band disassembles their sound, soaring play is once again restored as Trey whips through a series of nasty licks. Arguably a > into "Yerushalayim Shel Zahav" in lieu of whistling.   
  
[It's Ice](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/its-ice>) \- A little chaotic, but some really great Mike action on this one. > to an excellent "Stash."   
  
[Stash](<https://phish.net/jamcharts/song/stash>) \- A Live One version. Jam doesn't get too far out there, but there is a repetitious section beginning at 7:00 that ratchets up the tension considerably. The ending section is drawn out, furthering this effect.
